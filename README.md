# Basic JQuery Webpack Starting point

A starting point for a basic jquery app using Webpack. Functionality is very limited.

### Installation

`npm install` or `yarn install`
`npm start` or `yarn start` for developement

### Production build

`npm run predeploy` or `yarn predeploy` for production build

### Deployment
I've got [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) preconfigured for deployment. In package.json uncomment "deploy" and add a domain. If you've never used surge.sh you may need to create an account.
`npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`
